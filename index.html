				or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on Hover.gg.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				If you choose to find your friends through your contacts list, then
				Hover.gg will access your contacts list to determine whether or not
				someone associated with your contact is using Hover.gg.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				If you choose to find your friends through a third-party social media
				site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party

			<p class="document-paragraph">
				If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames
				on Hover.gg then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search
				on our Service for you.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				Note about “Invite” feature(s): If you choose to invite someone through
				the Service, you may select a person directly from the contacts list on
				your device and send a p or email from your personal account. You
				understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply
				to communications sent from your device, and because this invitation is
				coming directly from your personal account, Hover.gg does not have access
				to or control this communication.
			</p>
			<p class="document-heading">
				Cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies:
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies
				like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about
				how you use Hover.gg and provide features to you.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service,
				we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely
				store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data
				files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile
				device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier
				may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in
				connection with the device&apos;s operating system or other software, or
				data sent to the device by Hover.gg.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party
				partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others
				provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the
				Service may not function properly if use or availability of device
				identifiers is impaired or disabled.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your
				devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us or the
				third party.
			</p>
			<p class="document-heading">Log file and other analytics:</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time
				you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also
				be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your
				browser or device.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log
				file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”)
				address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks
				and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing
				pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect
				similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track
				which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				We may use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and
				usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your
				device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and
				other information to assist us in improving the Service. This analytics
				information is aggregated with analytics information from other Users so
				that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual
				User.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the
				Service.
			</p>
			<p class="document-heading">Feedback:</p>

			<p class="document-heading">Metadata:</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content.
				For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User
				Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
			</p>
			<p class="document-paragraph">
				Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a
				hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords when you post), geotag (e.g., to mark your
				location), comments or other data. This makes your User Content more
				searchable by others and more interactive. If you geotag your User Content
				then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the content and
				searchable (e.g., through a location or map feature) if your content is
				made public by you in accordance with your privacy settings.[c]
